### Artificial Intelligence Quotient, in the age of Teenager Screentime

### My attempt to understand teaching teenagers in the age of Screen Time Addiction and Artificial Intelligence

At the end of the 2023-2024 school year, things are fairly bleak about educatimg the general population of high school students from my perspective. Next year my school is starting a scchool wide awareness of the problems with screen time and the negative effects multiple screens are having on our students mental health, the classroom environment and basic student respect for learning.

### Ellis AIQ

**Types of Screen-Addicted Students and IMHO (in my humble opinion) How to Teach Them:**

1. **Producers (5-20%)**  
   University or trade-bound students who excel in various areas. They can play instruments, write, learn, read, play sports, help others, and thrive with or without AI. They may have overcome significant hurdles and use AI to enhance their learning. Increased technology has allowed significant growth in the number of truly capable students. These students need to be continuously challenged at their level to further their development.

   **Educational Goals:**  
   - Foster pride in their abilities.
   - Encourage lifelong learning.
   - Inspire them to contribute positively to society and the planet.

   **Teaching Strategies:**
   - Provide advanced and enriched curriculum options.
   - Encourage participation in extracurricular activities and competitions.
   - Promote mentorship opportunities with industry professionals.

2. **Screenagers (5-20%)**  
   Highly intelligent students who are fully screen-time addicted and may have other addictions. They often exploit loopholes to maintain their screen time and may even teach others to do the same. While they occasionally produce excellent work, it is usually in areas of personal interest. They face various challenges, including learning and social issues, but their primary issue is screen-time addiction.

   **Educational Goals:**  
   - Develop self-sufficiency in motivation and learning.
   - Address and manage their addictions.

   **Teaching Strategies:**
   - Set clear and consistent boundaries regarding screen time.
   - Engage them in interest-based projects to channel their intelligence positively.
   - Provide support for underlying issues, such as counseling for addictions.

3. **Emergent and Addicted (5-20%)**  
   Students with significant learning challenges who are deeply engaged with screen time. They may have multiple disabilities or have faced significant trauma, often using screen time as a primary reward. These students benefit greatly from both social and AI-supported learning.

   **Educational Goals:**  
   - Develop social and safety skills.
   - Achieve employability in supportive environments.

   **Teaching Strategies:**
   - Implement a balanced approach to learning, alternating between social and academic goals.
   - Avoid using screen time as a reward in the classroom.
   - Provide long-term support and involve multidisciplinary teams for comprehensive care.

4. **Developing and Addicted (30-85%)**  
   Typical high school students with some learning issues, possible disabilities, or past trauma. They use social media and gaming extensively but can improve with proper guidance. This group includes various social stereotypes from the 80s like Nerds, Jocks, Goths, and Punk rockers.

   **Educational Goals:**  
   - Manage screen time effectively.
   - Encourage pride in hard-earned academic achievements.
   - Help them find a balance between their interests and abilities.

   **Teaching Strategies:**
   - Enforce school cell phone policies.
   - Use AI tools to enhance learning while maintaining screen time limits.
   - Offer support for social and emotional development.

5. **Developing, Not Addicted (0-5%)**  
   Traditional C+/B students who are not heavily influenced by screen time. They likely have supportive parents and engage in various activities outside of school.

   **Educational Goals:**  
   - Maintain pride in their academic efforts.
   - Discover and develop their areas of interest and ability.

   **Teaching Strategies:**
   - Continue traditional teaching methods.
   - Encourage participation in diverse activities to broaden their interests.

6. **Other (0-5%)**  
   Atypical students who require individualized teaching approaches.

   **Educational Goals:**  
   - Develop personalized educational goals through attentive listening and collaboration.

   **Teaching Strategies:**
   - Conduct one-on-one meetings to understand their needs and aspirations.
   - Tailor the curriculum to meet their unique requirements.

These suggestions aim to make the document more comprehensive, structured, and actionable for educators.

old list




1. __Producers:(5-20%)__ University or trade bound students that can do and solve almost anything. They are stable, can play instruments, write, learn, they read, they play sports and help others, socially fine and they thrive with or without AI. They may have had issues but have overcome all hurdles. They typically use AI to simplify and increase their own learning. In the 80's these students were very rare for example a school with an obvious valedictorian, but increased technology has allowed significant growth in the number of truly capable students.  These students need to be challenged, at their level, to be better in all areas. Challenging these students, does not, and should not, take much effort from the teacher. Educational Goals: Pride in their abilities, learn everything, and work towards helping people and the planet. 

  
2. __Screenager:(5-20%)__ These students are fully screen time addicted and/or have other serious addictions and will use their high intelligence to stay addicted. They will find holes in all attempts to reduce their screentime and may gain notriety showing others how to evade school screentime rules. They randomly and occasionally produce high level assingments but only when it is of interest to them. They may have a mulititude of real and imagined issues including but not limited by: specific learning issues, social issues, physical and emotional disabilities, hygiene issues, etc, etc, but the key issue is the screentime addictions.  They will use all kinds of excuses for why things do not get completed instead of using personal will-power or AI to help them learn. Some of these students will do fine when they finish High School. Do not expect much change from them during the school year. Challenging these students at their interest area can take a lot of effort both physical and emotionally from the teacher. The true issue here is addiction and all the facets of addiction and not their learning ability. There isn't really an 80's equivalent for these students. Educational Goals: to become self-sufficient with motivation and learning. First steps is to dela with the addictions and see if this student should really be in a different group.

3. __Emergent and Addicted:(5-20%)__ Students who face significant learning challenges and are fully engaged with screen time. These students may have multiple disabilities and or faced significant trauma and may have often been allowed screen time as a primary reward throughout their lives. Hopefully these students have signifcant long term support from both the government and the school system for long term care. These students can gain the most advantage from both social and AI supported learning and careful reduction of the Pavolovian reward of screentime for small gains. It sometimes helps to seperate social goals from academic goals for these students, perhaps taking turns between the two. Reward screentime is not acceptable in the regular class so this issue will need to be sorted out. This group also does not really have an 80's equivalent as many of these students were not in the public school setting, and the public education system was not very understanding of the issues. Educational Goals: to be socially and safety capable and employable in a government supported or public setting.

4. __Developing and Addicted:(30-85%)__ These are normal High School students, probably have some learning issues, possibly a disablility or two, have suffered some loss or trauma, prefer some subjects over others, probably have some social issues, wanting to find their place, use social media and/or gaming a lot. These students can improve and learn at high school with guidance, school cell phone rules, sensible use of AI to increase learning and concentrated effort from the teaching staff. This group makes up almost all the sterotypes of the 80's such as the Nerds, Jocks, Goth, Punk rockers, Dyslexic. Educational Goals: To control screentime and be proud of hard earned grades no matter what level and to find their niche of interest overlap with ability.


5. __Developing not-addicted:(0-5%)__ There aren't many! These students are your traditional C+/B students. You might have a few in your class, if so they probably have aware parents that try to keep a traditional home with family time and lots of activities. Hopefully your class has a few of them. No addtional effort other than traditional teaching is needed with these students. In the 80's this would be your average student. Educational Goals: To be proud of hard earned grades no matter what level and to find their niche of interest overlap with ability.
   
6. __Other:(0-5%)__ There aren't many! These students are atypical, and need to be taught on an individual bases. Educational Goals: These students need to be fully listened to and worked with to deteermine educational goals.

## What to do?

This part will change as teachers and schools try different methods.

I will try to teach my students to use their screen time and AI for learning and to understand that leisure time
is for when you have finished learning / work and want some casual low brain activity to relax, while realizing 
that their are other ways to relax as well as screen time. (Wish me luck)

I also have cell phone holders I made in 2017 but basically gave up on during covid.

## How to Teach:

See the above student types:

Encourage Producers to learn everything they can, every minute in the class room needs to be spent learning. Identify and survive the Screenagers attempts to divert learning. School addiction programs might help with this. Emergent and Addicted need support and sperate social goals from academic ones. Use AI and technology as much as possible to automate the learning and seperate social learning as specific tasks as needed. Spend most of your time on the upto 85% of students who are Developing and Addicted. The Developing and Addicted have the potential for the most growth in all areas once school and after school screen time is reduced.


## What is needed from Others

### Parents


### Administration


### others






## Good luck, It is a journet, at least I can retire if it does not go well.
