### Artificial Intelligence Quotient

### My attempt to understand teaching teenagers in the age of screen time addiction and Artificial Intelligence


### Ellis AIQ  

Types of Screen Addicted students and IMHO (In my humble opinion) how to teach them.

1. __Producers:__ University or trade bound students that can do and solve almost anything. They are stable, can play instruments, write, learn, they read, play sports and help others, socially fine and they thrive with or without AI. May have had issues but have overcome all hurdles. 

  
2. __ScreenTime Addicted and Hi IQ:__ These students are fully screen time or other types of addicted and will use their high intelligence to stay addicted. They randomly and occasionally produce high level assingments but only when it is of interest to them. Some of these students will do fine. Do not expect much change during the school year at a high time and emotional cost to the teacher.

3. __Emergent and Addicted:__ Students who face significant learning challenges and are fully engaged with screen time. These students may have multiple disabilities and or faced significant trauma and have often been allowed screen time as a primary reward throughout their lives.

4. __Developing and Addicted:__ These are normal High School students, probably have some learning issues, possibly a disablility or two, prefer some subjects over others, probably have some social issues, wanting to find their place, use social media and/or gaming a lot. These students can improve and learn at high school with guidance, school cell phone rules, sensible use of AI to increase learning and teacher effort
   
5. __Developing not-addicted:__ There aren't many! These students are your traditional C+/B students. You might have a few in your class, if so they probably have aware parents that try to keep a traditional home with family time and lots of activities. Hopefully your class has a few of them.




## What to do?

This part will change as teachers and schools try different methods.

I will try to teach my students to use their screen time and AI for learning and to understand that leisure time
is for when you have finished learning / work and want some casual low brain activity to relax, while realizing 
that their are other ways to relax as well as screen time. (Wish me luck)

I also have cell phone holders I made in 2017 but basically gave up on during covid.

Her work underscores the importance of considering cultural factors when addressing teenage development and education. Mead's theory of the social self is based on the perspective that the self emerges from social interactions, such as observing and interacting with others, responding to others' opinions about oneself, and internalizing external opinions and internal feelings about oneself.
